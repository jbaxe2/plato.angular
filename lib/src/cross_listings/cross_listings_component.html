    Here you can cross-list groups of sections you are requesting so they can
    share a single course shell on Plato.  <em>(Note that this step is NOT
    necessary, and should ONLY be done under the guidance of CIT.  Please
    contact CIT if you have questions about cross-listing.)</em><br><br>
    Click the button to add a new cross-listing set, then add those sections to
    the set that you would like to share a single shell on Plato.  Repeat as
    needed.

  Click the <strong>Continue</strong> button to either skip this step, or after
  you have established your cross-listed courses.  <em>(Cross-listing sets cannot
  be empty or contain only one section.)</em>
